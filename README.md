# MSFS2020-Vatsim-Model-Matching
This model matching project is a community driven open source project based on BritishAvgeek and other contributors' previous work. It is my honor to have your contribution.
A good model matching can bring Vatsim flights as close to reality as possible.
To maximize the gaming experience, you can also start a request in either Discord or Github.
All requests will be responded as soon as I can.

# Highlight
Concorde AH1Z B717 B752 B753 B762 B763 B764 MD11 AN225 A300-600st Dash8Q3/Q4 CRJ700 E175 BAe146/RJ100 ARJ21 models included
(ModelMatching will create its own CRJ700 from now on, no need to buy the CRJ700 anymore)

# Instruction: 
1. You need to have model matching ivao_x_csl file in your MSFS2020 community folder, link:

2. Place all vmr files in the vPilot files folder
3. Add model matching files in vPilot client
4. Make sure VATSIM_Model_Matching_Master-Plato.vmr is on top in vPilot

# For editor:
For better tracking, please edit at the bottom for all vmr files.
Appreciate:)

# Note
Model matching files are widely available on Flightsim.to, you can add them to vPilot as well.
For the master model matching rule, this is the most comprehensive one as far as I know.

Hope you enjoy & thanks to all the contributors
