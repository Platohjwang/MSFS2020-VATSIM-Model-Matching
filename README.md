# MSFS2020-Vatsim-Model-Matching v0.5.0.0
This model matching project is a community driven open source project based on BritishAvgeek and JF team's previous work. It is my honor to have your contribution.
A good model matching can bring Vatsim flights as close to reality as possible.
To maximize the gaming experience, you can also start a request in either Discord or Github.
All requests will be responded as soon as I can.

# Highlight
B717 AN225 A300-600st models included

# Instruction:

# For editor:
For better tracking, please edit at the bottom of both vmr files.
Appreciate:)

# Note
Model matching files are widely available on Flightsim.to, you can add them to vPilot as well.
For Airline/Livery model matching, this is the most comprehensive one as far as I know.

Hope you enjoy & thanks to all the contributors
