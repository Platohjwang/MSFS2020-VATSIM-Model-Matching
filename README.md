# MSFS2020-Vatsim-Model-Matching v0.2.1

This model matching project is a community driven open source project based on BritishAvgeek's previous work. It is my honor to have your contribution.
A good model matching can bring Vatsim flights as close to reality as possible.
To maximize the gaming experience, you can also start an request in either Discord or Github.
All requests will be responded as soon as I can.

# Instruction: 
1. You need to have model matching ivao_x_csl file in your MSFS2020 community folder, link:
   https://www.ivao.aero/softdev/beta/altitudebeta.asp
2. Place the airlines_update-Plato.vmr file in the vPilot files folder
3. Add model matching file in vPilot client
4. Make sure airlines_update-Plato.vmr is on top in vPilot

# For editor:
For better tracking, please edit at the bottom of the vmr file.
Appreciate:)

# Note
Model matching files are widely available on Flightsim.to, you can add them to vPilot as well.
For Airplane/Airline model matching, this is the most comprehensive one as far as I know.

Hope you enjoy & thanks to all the contributors
