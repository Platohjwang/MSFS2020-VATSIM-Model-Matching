# MSFS2020-Vatsim-Model-Matching v0.3.0.1

This model matching project is a community driven open source project based on BritishAvgeek's previous work. It is my honor to have your contribution.
A good model matching can bring Vatsim flights as close to reality as possible.
To maximize the gaming experience, you can also start a request in either Discord or Github.
All requests will be responded as soon as I can.

# Instruction: 
1. You need to have model matching ivao_x_csl file in your MSFS2020 community folder, link:
   https://www.ivao.aero/softdev/beta/altitudebeta.asp
2. Place both vmr files in the vPilot files folder
3. Add model matching files in vPilot client
4. Make sure Airlines_Modelmatching_update-Plato.vmr is on top in vPilot

# For editor:
For better tracking, please edit at the bottom of both vmr files.
Appreciate:)

# Note
Model matching files are widely available on Flightsim.to, you can add them to vPilot as well.
For Airline/Livery model matching, this is the most comprehensive one as far as I know.

Hope you enjoy & thanks to all the contributors
